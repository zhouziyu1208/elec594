# Vacuum Rabi Oscillations Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates and visualizes **Vacuum Rabi Oscillations** in a coupled cavity-atom system using the Jaynes-Cummings model. The simulation includes dissipation and thermal noise, allowing exploration of the effects of these factors on the oscillations.
